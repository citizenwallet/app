# Citizen Wallet

A mobile wallet to bring citizens to web3.

## What is the Citizen Wallet?

It's a crypto wallet that allows you to receive and send USDc tokens (for now) without any prior knowledge of crypto.
No need to know what a seedphrase is or what are gas fees.

## Why did you create the Citizen Wallet? Aren't they enough crypto wallets out there?

Our goal is to make web3 work for citizens. We started a few DAOs (allforclimate DAO, DAO.brussels, Regens Unite DAO). Every time we were confronted with the need to onboard non crypto people to web3. Asking them to install Metamask or download a mobile wallet that assumes that you are a trader, was all but ideal.

That's why we started working on a crypto wallet for citizens. One that any DAO or dApp could recommend to their community to start receiving and sending their tokens.

## Is it secure?

The Citizen Wallet is designed to be used by citizens as their every day wallet. It is good enough and safe enough for keeping small change, like you know, you would do in a regular wallet. Now we wouldn't recommend keeping gold bars in it (nor in your regular wallet).

## What if I lose my device?

People won't be able to spend your tokens if they cannot unlock your device. Whenever you get a new device, you can restore your phone, your keychain and you will recover access to your tokens.

## Has it been audited?

Not yet. So use at your own risk for now. You can help us accelerate this process by contributing to the [Citizen Wallet Collective](https://citizenwallet.xyz/contribute).

## How does it work?

We are generating a private key that is stored on your device's keychain. When you restore your phone (or get a new one), you will recover your Citizen Wallet with all the funds. No need to write down a seed phrase.

We are using the Polygon blockchain (for now) and the latest [EIP4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard to make sure you don't have to pay for gas. We will soon make it available for any community with their own community currency.

## Who is behind this?

The Citizen Wallet is an open source project ([Github](https://github.com/citizenwallet)). It's developed by the community for the community. Everyone is invited to contribute to make sure we can keep this as a public good.
