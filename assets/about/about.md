# Citizen Wallet

A wallet that allows easy token exchange.

## What is the Citizen Wallet?

It allows you to receive and send USDC tokens in a safe and secure way.

No need to worry about transactions fees.

## Why did you create the Citizen Wallet? Aren't they enough wallet apps out there?

Our goal is to make token exchange work for citizens. Through founding various organizations (allforclimate DAO, DAO.brussels, Regens Unite DAO), we were confronted with the need to onboard people to complex trading apps. Asking them to install a mobile wallet that assumes that you are a trader was all but ideal.

That's why we started working on a wallet for citizens. One that any organization or event could recommend to their community to start receiving and sending their tokens.

## Is it secure?

The Citizen Wallet is designed to be used by citizens as their every day wallet. It is good enough and safe enough for keeping small change, similar to a physical wallet.

Your account is generated, **owned and controlled by you**. The access key is encrypted and stored on your device's cloud backup. This means that you can **easily migrate to a new device** and bring your accounts with you while making sure that **no one else has access to your accounts**.

## What if I lose my device?

People won't be able to exchange your tokens if they cannot unlock your device. Whenever you get a new device, you can restore it and you will **recover access to your tokens**.

## How does it work?

Citizen Wallet is open source, feel free to [take a look at the internals](https://github.com/citizenwallet/app).

## What network do you use?

We use Polygon and the latest [ERC4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) standard to make sure that you don't have to pay for transactions.

Our aim is to make it available for any community and network with their own tokens.

## Has it been audited?

While [ERC4337](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/eip-4337-ethereum-account-abstraction-incremental-audit) has been audited, our implementation of it and use of it has not. You can help us accelerate this process by contributing to the [Citizen Wallet Collective](https://citizenwallet.xyz/contribute).

## Who is behind this?

The Citizen Wallet is an open source project ([Github](https://github.com/citizenwallet)). It's developed by the community for the community. Everyone is invited to contribute to make sure we can keep this as a public good.
